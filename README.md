# Google Migration with Ruby
Migrate Google Docs to Local repository and back to Google

This project was created to download documents from Google Drive for A domain in a Google Apps Account. Then later, it would upload the documents back to Drive in a new Google Apps Account.
There are other methods to transfer files from Google Apps domain to another. These methods involve 3rd party companies and $3-$5 charge per user. I work with in a School District with 7700 students. Cost would be in the range of 23,100 and 38,500.
